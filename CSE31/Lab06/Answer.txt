1) there are two bugs, pointers move at the wrong value
2) change integer 1, in line 14 and 15, to 4
3) assemble and run the instructions, Mars will report errors
4) line 28
5) line 33
6) la
7) the loop starts at line 35, line 44 copys offset of 6 to 3
8) addu	$8,$8,1
   purpose: $8+1 address, initiates the address $8
   sll	$3,$8,2
   purpose: $3+1*2, initiates the address, $3 = k + 1
   addu	$5,$7,$9
   purpose: declare source k
   addu	$2,$3,$9
   purpose: declare source address
   addu	$6,$7,$10
   purpose: declare dest k
   lw	$4,0($2)
   load word from offset of 2 to 4, source k+1 value
   move	$7,$3
   purpose: move content of k+1 to 7
   lw	$3,0($5)
   purpose: load word from offset of 5 to 3, dest k+1 value
   #nop
   sw	$3,0($6)
   purpose: copy content from offset of 6 to 3
   bne  $4,$0,$L6
   purpose: loop back to L6 if and only if 4 is not 0
